== Introduction

This document outlines a specialized vector extension instruction set based on the RISC-V RVV 1.0 specification, 
tailored for wireless digital signal processing. This extension supplements the RVV instruction set and primarily 
addresses the demands of wireless digital signal processing. 

Key additions include:  
* Definitions for vector state register extension fields 
* Complex dynamic scaling operation instructions 
* Complex compressed format conversion instructions 
* Vector register element inter-operation instructions 
* Fixed-point dynamic scaling operation instructions  
* Dynamic scaling multiply-accumulate operation instructions
* Fast nonlinear operation instructions with dynamic scaling 

Currently, RISC-V Vector Working Group developed the RVV 1.0 vector extension, widely applied in AI and image processing. 
However, these basic instructions do not fully satisfy the requirements of wireless broadband signal processing, which 
involves handling complex numbers in 4G and 5G communications and demands high-precision fixed-point dynamic scaling. 
Therefore, additional and more effective vector extension instructions are necessary for wireless communication, covering 
a significant segment of vector signal processing needs, especially for 4G and 5G technologies.  The wireless signal 
processing extension instruction built on the RVV extension can accelerate advancements in 4G and 5G signal processing 
and facilitate the adoption of RISC-V in the wireless signal processing domain.  

The instruction set extends the RVV 1.0 specification to support high-bandwidth wireless communication signal processing. 
Termed the vector wireless broadband extension instruction set and represented by 'Zvw', it integrates into the basic 'v' 
extension. The Zvw extension adapts RVV instructions to better suit the high bandwidth, high-order modulation, and large 
throughput demands of wireless signal processing, particularly in 4G and 5G communications. 

Currently, Zvw supports only RV32, with SEW variations limited to 8/16/32, where SEW=32 supports SC16. In SC16, real and 
imaginary parts are stored in adjacent vector register units (real in lower bits, imaginary in upper bits). For SC32, real 
and imaginary parts are stored in indexed units of different vector registers.  The operational section addresses procedures 
on each vector processor element, adhering to LMUL and VL standards from the RVV specification. Operand objects are governed 
by SEW, execution on elements is controlled by vm, and default values for unprocessed elements by RVV-defined mask agnostic 
and tail agnostic rules.
